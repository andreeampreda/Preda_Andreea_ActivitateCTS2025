CTS Activity 2025

This repository contains the work developed during the **Software Quality and Testing (CTS)** lab sessions in the second semester of the third academic year at the Faculty of Cybernetics, Statistics and Economic Informatics (ASE Bucharest). It also includes additional exercises and implementations created individually at home to deepen the understanding of the concepts discussed in class.

## Course Overview

- Understand the importance of software quality and how to evaluate and improve it
- Learn and apply software testing techniques (unit, integration, system testing)
- Develop object-oriented software following SOLID principles and clean code practices
- Implement and use common design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Strategy, Observer, Factory)
- Use testing frameworks such as JUnit to validate software functionality

## Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 17+)
- IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code
- JUnit for unit testing
